                we need more people in this type work. Plan B is to go into the military.

                <h2>Noa Newcom</h2>
                <p>Well I was born in Hawaii and grew up in Aiea where I went to Alvah Scoot elementry<br> my grades were okay but nothing special but it was kinda bad at the same time,</br> it started in middle school where I started to care more about my grades and started to put in more effort on my end<br>
                but I had people. That helped me through times because of that I was able to push through</br> because of them I think I improved.  </p>

            <div id="box">
                <p>growing up I moved around to many different schools and all the things I had in common, <br> 
                    my grades well average and I would barely try, during those times because I thought it wouldn't help me in the future</br>
                but it wasn't till middle school that some of my teachers realize that I shouldn't give up and some of my friends did too<br>
            so now my goal for grades to be at least B to A while I currectly attend Aiea high school</p>
